Introduction
============

This is my [Xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) configuration.

I have used:

* [xmobar](http://gorgias.mine.nu/xmobar/) for a status bar displaying useful information (e.g., workspaces, time and date, CPU usage)
* [trayer](http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/trayer) for the traybar.

Colors are taken from the [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/) theme.

Feel free to take it and modify it as you see fit.
